/*
The 50-30-20 strategy is a simple way to budget, which involves spending 50% of after-tax income on needs, 30% after tax income on wants, and 20% after-tax income on savings or paying off debt.

Given the after-tax income asÂ `ati`, what you are supposed to do is to make a function that will return an object that shows how much a person needs to spend on needs, wants, and savings.
